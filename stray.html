    <h4>Who was Johannes Vermeer?</h4>
    <p><font size="6" color="white">Johannes Vermeer is one of the most famous Dutch painters of the 17th century. He is famous for his intimate household scenes with amazing light. In other paintings by Vermeer, such as the famous Girl with a Pearl Earring and View of Delft, he managed to create a calm, almost timeless atmosphere.</p>
<h2><font color="lightpink">Vermeer's life and his importance!</h2>
    <p><font size="6" color="white">There is considerable evidence that Vermeer worked for the upper echelon of Delft society. Van Ruijven and his wife, Maria de Knuijt, were very wealthy Delft patricians who could purchase any paintings they wished without making a dent in their finances.</p>
        <p><font size="6" color="white">And this, I guess, is why I'm so entranced by Vermeer. More than any other great painter, he gives us what we might think of as a philosophy, about the relationship between art and everyday life. This is perhaps because he lived so much more of said 'everyday' life than other Masters.Unlike most Dutch painters Vermeer made lavish use of the coloring substance called natural ultramarine, the most brilliant and revered blue available to painters. Ultramarine paint was made by crushing the semi-precious stone called lapis lazuli to a fine powder and mixing it with walnut oil to form a sticky paste. </p>

        <p><font size="5" color="white" >Girl with a Pearl Earring (c. 1665) is probably Johannes Vermeer's most famous work, but he is also known for his genre paintings. His subjects are often women in interior scenes completing chores, as in The Milkmaid </p>
